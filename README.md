# Spatial Simulator

## Overview

Spatial Simulator is a tool designed for understanding spatial dynamics and their implications on society. While it originated with a focus on ecology, we now emphasize the concept of space as a social construct, inviting users to explore how spatial arrangements influence social interactions, cultural expressions, and community formation.

## Features
- Interactive simulations to explore various spatial scenarios.
- Analytical tools to assess the impact of spatial decisions on social constructs.
- Community-driven insights and contributions that highlight the diversity of spatial experiences.
